# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-disaster
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.  One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
In this challenge, you have to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. Here, you need to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
The data has been split into 2 groups:training set(train.csv) and testing test(test.csv).
The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. 
The testing set will apply your algorithm to each and every individual and predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
A submission.csv file is attached to show how your output should look like while predicting the survival of rest of the passengers.
